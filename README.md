# Fight The Ice Core Exceptions Component

Set of exceptions shared across Fight The Ice components. 

This lets you catch library-specific exceptions (if needed).

This repository isn't really of value to use in your projects. 

You may however want to fork/clone this repository to build your own exception classes.

Most of the documentation included here is just for personal reference.

## Installation

The best way to use this component is through Composer:

```BASH
$ composer require fighttheice/exceptions
```

## Usage

There are actually two steps to follow when trying to use the features of this library.

[1] - Create your own exception classes by extending any of the FightTheIce\Exceptions\\{class}

```php

class YourAwesomeException extends \FightTheIce\Exceptions\DomainException {
	protected $component = 'Your component name';
}
```

[2] - In your code (try,...catch) you have the following options
```php
...
try {
	$obj->someMethod();
} catch (\YourAwesome $e) {
	//Catch your specific execption
} catch (\FightTheIce\Exceptions\DomainException $e) {
	//catch FTI specific exception
} catch (\DomainException $e) {
	//catch SPL exception
} catch (\FightTheIce\Exceptions\ExceptionsInterface $e) {
	//catch all FTI exceptions
} catch (\Exception $e) {
	//catch Generic exception
}
```

NOTE: It is expected that you will extend the exception libraries in order to set the component property value.
To retrieve this value run the following:
```php
try {
	$obj->someMethod();
} catch (\YourAwesome $e) {
	//Catch your specific execption
	$component = $e->getComponent(); //your component name or "UNKNOWN"
}
```

## Building

The building tool "project.generate" is just a PHP script that uses laminas-code to generate the exception libraries and tests. 

[1] - Fork/Clone repository

[2] - Run composer install/update
```bash
$ composer install
$ composer update
```

[3] - Execute the project.generate file
```bash
$ php project.generate
```

[4] - Composer Dump autoload
```bash
$ composer dump-autolod
```

[5] - Execute PHPUnit tests
```bash
$ ./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/
```

[6] - Get code coverage report
```bash
$ ./vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-html html tests/
```
