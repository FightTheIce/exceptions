# Fight The Ice Exceptions Component

Set of exceptions shared across Fight The Ice components. This lets you catch library-specific exceptions (if needed).

## Credits

I blatantly stole (forked) this code from https://github.com/brightnucleus/exceptions. 
All I did was write the convert.php file that changed the names across the filebase to match my namespace.


## Installation

The best way to use this component is through Composer:

```BASH
$ composer require fighttheice/exceptions
```
